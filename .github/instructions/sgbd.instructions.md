\# Copilot instructions for this repo



Purpose

\- This repository is for a course. Keep code simple and explicit for learning.

\- The main goal is core understanding.



Style rules (high level)

\- Prefer readability over clever/compact code.

\- Do not over-engineer the existing code and do not try to implement additional functions, except if explicitly requested; keep the format as close to origin.

\- Avoid micro-optimizations and advanced patterns unless explicitly requested.

\- Use short functions and clear names; prefer imperative/explicit code.



How I prefer suggestions

\- Show simple, step-by-step solutions with short comments.

\- Provide runnable code that can be copy/pasted into Visual Studio 2022.

\- If available in context, you can suggest more advanced optimizations, but not inside initial response.
